Let me break down each of the linked list questions in more detail:

### Basic Questions:

1. **Reverse a Linked List**: 
   - **Problem**: Given a singly linked list (a chain of nodes where each node points to the next), you need to reverse the order of the nodes so that the head (start) becomes the tail (end), and vice versa.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → null
     - Output: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → null
   - **Hint**: This involves iterating over the list and reversing the pointers between nodes.

2. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List**:
   - **Problem**: A cycle exists in a linked list if a node’s next pointer points back to one of the earlier nodes in the list. Your task is to detect whether a given linked list has such a cycle.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 (points back to 2)
     - Output: True (because of the cycle)
   - **Hint**: You can use Floyd’s cycle-finding algorithm (also called the "tortoise and hare" algorithm) to detect the cycle.

3. **Find the Middle of a Linked List**:
   - **Problem**: Given a singly linked list, find the node that is in the middle of the list.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null
     - Output: Node with value 3
   - **Hint**: Use two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other, so when the faster pointer reaches the end, the slower one will be in the middle.

4. **Remove N-th Node from End**:
   - **Problem**: Given a linked list, remove the N-th node from the end of the list.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, N = 2
     - Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5
   - **Hint**: Use two pointers, where one starts N nodes ahead, and then move both until the first pointer reaches the end.

5. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**:
   - **Problem**: Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: List1: 1 → 3 → 5, List2: 2 → 4 → 6
     - Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
   - **Hint**: Compare the nodes in both lists one by one and link them in sorted order.

### Intermediate Questions:

6. **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**:
   - **Problem**: Given two singly linked lists, find if they intersect (i.e., they merge at some node). If they do, return the intersecting node.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: List1: 1 → 2 → 3 \
               List2: 6 → 7 → 3 \
       (Both lists share the node with value 3)
     - Output: Node with value 3
   - **Hint**: Traverse both lists to find where they meet.

7. **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted linked list, remove duplicate nodes so that each element appears only once.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 4
     - Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
   - **Hint**: Since the list is sorted, you can compare each node with the next and remove duplicates.

8. **Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists**:
   - **Problem**: Two linked lists represent two numbers where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order (least significant digit comes first). Add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: (2 → 4 → 3) + (5 → 6 → 4)
     - Output: 7 → 0 → 8 (because 342 + 465 = 807)
   - **Hint**: Simulate the addition process as you would do on paper, carrying over when the sum exceeds 9.

9. **Rotate a Linked List**:
   - **Problem**: Rotate a linked list to the right by `k` positions.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, k = 2
     - Output: 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3
   - **Hint**: Break the list at a specific point and reattach the parts in a different order.

10. **Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List**:
    - **Problem**: Given a doubly linked list where each node may also point to a sublist (another doubly linked list), flatten it into a single-level list.
    - **Example**:
      - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 \
                |    → 7 → 8 \
               4 → 5 → 6
      - Output: 1 → 2 → 7 → 8 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
    - **Hint**: Recursively explore and flatten each sublist.

### Advanced Questions:

11. **Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers**:
    - **Problem**: Each node in a linked list has a "random" pointer that can point to any other node (or null). Write a function to clone the list with these random pointers.
    - **Example**: 
      - Input: List with random pointers
      - Output: Deep copy of the list with random pointers preserved
    - **Hint**: First create copies of each node, then correctly set their random pointers.

12. **Reverse Nodes in k-Group**:
    - **Problem**: Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, leave the last nodes as they are.
    - **Example**:
      - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, k = 2
      - Output: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 5
    - **Hint**: Reverse nodes in groups of `k` using a loop.

13. **Reorder List**:
    - **Problem**: Reorder a linked list such that the list becomes: \
      `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...`
    - **Example**:
      - Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
      - Output: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3
    - **Hint**: Split the list in half, reverse the second half, and merge the two halves alternately.

14. **Sort a Linked List**:
    - **Problem**: Given a linked list, sort it in O(n log n) time using merge sort.
    - **Hint**: Break the list into halves, recursively sort, and merge.

15. **Detect the Starting Point of a Cycle**:
    - **Problem**: If a cycle exists in a linked list, find the node where the cycle begins.
    - **Hint**: After detecting the cycle, use two pointers to find the starting point of the cycle.

### Conceptual Questions:

16. **Time Complexity of Linked List Operations**:
    - **Problem**: Understand the time complexities for insertion, deletion, and traversal operations in linked lists.
    - **Hint**: Insertion/deletion at the head is O(1), but at any other position, it takes O(n). Traversal is always O(n).

17. **Differences Between Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists**:
    - **Problem**: Explain how these types of linked lists differ in structure and use cases.
    - **Hint**: Singly lists only point to the next node, doubly lists point to both next and previous nodes, and circular lists link back to the start.

18. **Array vs. Linked List**:
    - **Problem**: Explain when you would prefer using a linked list over an array.
    - **Hint**: Linked lists are better when you need frequent insertions/deletions, but arrays provide faster access to elements (O(1) vs. O(n)).

19. **Memory Management in Linked Lists**:
    - **Problem**: Explain how memory is managed in linked lists and how to prevent memory leaks.
    - **Hint**: Each node is dynamically allocated memory, and it’s important to properly free memory after deleting nodes.

20. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Linked Lists**:
    - **Problem**: Understand the pros and cons of using linked lists as a data structure.
    - **Hint**: They are flexible with memory usage and easy to insert/delete, but slower to access elements compared to arrays.
